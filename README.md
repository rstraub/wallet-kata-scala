# Wallet Kata in Scala

A solution to the [Wallet Kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/Wallet/) in Scala.

Focus points are to solve it in a functional style,
applying the lessons of the book I'm reading: [Grokking Simplicity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52257623-grokking-simplicity?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_17).

Specifically I want to:
- Separate Actions from Calculations and Data
- Apply Stratified Design
- Stay away from my habitual OOP style unless it makes sense
- Do functional error handling

Additionally, it is a good opportunity to show of the dependency inversion principle when integrating with an external API.
